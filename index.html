        <h1>Tebogo Mogale's Journey</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Tebogo Mogale, and I matriculated from Mohumi Secondary School. I’m currently in my third year of studying BEngTech Electrical Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT). My journey into engineering was inspired by my mentor, Mr. Makwela NN, who pursued a BEngTech Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Johannesburg (UJ).
        </p>

        <h2>Early Life and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            I was raised by my grandparents after losing my mother at a young age, as my father was never present in my life. Growing up, their support and values shaped my resilience and determination. My academic journey has been anything but straightforward. In Grade 8, I excelled in Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Technology. However, things took a turn when I switched schools to join friends whose goals didn't align with mine. This decision led to a decline in my performance, teaching me a valuable lesson about peer influence and staying true to my aspirations.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2021, during my matric year, I faced another hurdle—a hospitalization for appendix surgery which disrupted my studies. Despite these challenges, I managed to pass with a diploma, though I wasn’t satisfied with my results. Toward the end of the year, my Mathematics teacher, Mr. Kgatla, recognized my potential and gave me the opportunity to teach Financial Mathematics to my classmates. That experience ignited my passion for sharing knowledge and empowering others.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "Not having both parents around could have easily become an obstacle for me, as it has for many others. However, I chose not to let it define or limit my potential."
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Repeating Matric and Discovering Tutoring</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to repeat matric in 2022 because my initial results didn’t meet the requirements for the Electrical Engineering course I wanted to pursue. Additionally, I had personal reasons that made this decision necessary. Repeating matric turned out to be a blessing in disguise—it allowed me to prove to myself that I could achieve excellence. During this time, I discovered my love for tutoring when my teachers entrusted me with teaching Science subjects to my peers and assisting lower grades in Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
            I passed my second matric attempt with flying colors, achieving Level 6 in all subjects except English, where I scored 68%. This success reaffirmed my belief in hard work and perseverance.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspiration from DK Lekola Global Education Institute</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, during my first year at university, I discovered DK Lekola Global Education Institute, an organization dedicated to empowering students through education, career guidance, and resources. Their mission resonated deeply with me—they brought together students from different provinces, provided study materials, assisted with university applications, and offered mentorship. Inspired by their work, I reached out to them when I thought I might be defunded by NSFAS. DK Lekola connected me with learners who needed tutoring, allowing me to earn money to support myself while continuing my education. This experience deepened my appreciation for mentorship and the transformative power of education.
        </p>

        <h2>Co-Founding Infinity Academy</h2>
        <p>
            Inspired by my experiences and DK Lekola Global Education Institute, I co-founded Infinity Academy with Mr. Makwela NN in 2023. Together, we tutored students from various schools, helping them secure spots in universities and colleges across different provinces. One of our proudest achievements was securing a distinction in Mathematics for one of our students.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2024, I expanded my reach by becoming a private tutor for Statistics and Probability at my university. Through dedication and tailored support, I achieved a 100% pass rate among my students and produced several distinctions. Beyond academics, Infinity Academy holds immense personal significance for me. Having lost my mother and grown up without my father, I couldn’t always celebrate my achievements the way I wanted to. However, seeing the students we help make their parents proud brings me immense joy and fulfillment.

        <h2>Advice to Students</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Step out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself daily.</li>
            <li>Believe in yourself and recognize that you are capable of achieving greatness.</li>
            <li>Choose friends who inspire and push you toward your goals.</li>
            <li>Your situation, what you lack, where you sleep, and what you eat should be your greatest motivator. You don’t necessarily need external motivation to start working. Let your circumstances drive you to take action because you know what you want to change and achieve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            My ultimate goal is to expand Infinity Academy into a well-known program that addresses educational gaps and empowers learners nationwide. I envision growing the initiative to include more subjects, mentorship opportunities, and career guidance services. By creating pathways for success, I hope to inspire young people to believe in their potential and build brighter futures for themselves and their communities.
